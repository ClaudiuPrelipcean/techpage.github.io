            C# was designed by Anders Hejlsberg from Microsoft in 2000
             and was later approved as an international standard 
             by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270) 
             in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET 
             Framework and Visual Studio, both of which were closed-source. 
             At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years 
             later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Mono began,
              providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for 
              the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released 
              Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified
               .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free,
                open-source, and cross-platform. Mono also joined Microsoft but was not 
                merged into .NET.
As of 2021, the most recent version of the language is C# 10.0,
 which was released in 2021 in .NET 6.0.[16][17]

         <header>Design goals</header>
         <p>The Ecma standard lists these design goals for C#:</p>
<ul>
   <li> The language is intended to be a simple, modern,
 general-purpose, object-oriented programming language.</li>
<li>The language, and implementations thereof, should provide support for 
software engineering principles such as strong type checking, array 
bounds checking, detection of attempts to use uninitialized variables, 
and automatic garbage collection. Software robustness, durability, and 
programmer productivity are important.</li>
<li>The language is intended for use in developing software components suitable
 for deployment in distributed environments.</li>
</ul>
  <p>Portability is very important for source code and programmers, especially those 
already familiar with C and C++.
Support for internationalization is very important.
C# is intended to be suitable for writing applications for both hosted and embedded
 systems, ranging from the very large that use sophisticated operating systems, down
  to the very small having dedicated functions.</p>

         <p>
            C# supports strongly, implicitly typed variable declarations with the 
            keyword <span class="keywords">var</span>, and implicitly typed arrays with 
            the keyword <span class="keywords">new[]</span> followed by a collection initializer.
            C# supports a strict Boolean data type, <span class="keywords">bool</span>. Statements that take conditions,
             such as <span class="keywords">while</span> and <span class="keywords">if</span>, require an expression of a type that implements the true
              operator, such as the Boolean type. While C++ also has a Boolean type, it can
               be freely converted to and from integers, and expressions such as if (a) require
                only that a is convertible to bool, allowing a to be an int, or a pointer.
                 C# disallows this "integer meaning true or false" approach, on the grounds
                  that forcing programmers to use expressions that return exactly bool can
                   prevent certain types of programming mistakes such as <span class="keywords">if (a = b)</span>  (use
                    of assignment <span class="keywords">=</span> instead of equality <span class="keywords">==</span>).

            Boxing is the operation of converting a value-type object into
             a value of a corresponding reference type. Boxing in C# is implicit.
            Unboxing is the operation of converting a value of a reference type
             (previously boxed) into a value of a value type. Unboxing in
              C# requires an explicit type cast. A boxed object of type T
               can only be unboxed to a T (or a nullable T).

                For code written as C# 8 or lower, the entry point logic of a program must be
                 written in a Main method inside a type:
                 <div class="container">
                     <div class="box">
                        <b><span style="color:green">using</span>
                            <span style="color:blue">System;</span> <br>
</b> 
                        // A version of the classic "Hello World" program
                        <b><span style="color:green">class</span>
                            <span style="color:blue">Program</span> <br>
</b> 
                        { <br>
                            <span style="color:green">static void</span> Main(string[] args) <br>
                            { <br>
                                Console.WriteLine(<span style="color:red">"Hello, world!"</span>); <br>
                            } <br>
                        }
                     </div>
                 </div>
             </li>
         </ul>
         <p>This code will display this text in the console window:</p>
         <p>
            <code> <div class="container">Hello, world!</div></code>
         </p>
         <p>Each line has a purpose:</p>
            <code>
             <div class="container">
            <b><span style="color:green">using</span>
                <span style="color:blue">System;</span>
</b> 
         </div>
        </code>
        
         <p>The above line imports all types in the System namespace. For example,
              the Console class used later in the source code is defined in the System
               namespace, meaning it can be used without supplying the full name
                of the type (which includes the namespace).</p>
